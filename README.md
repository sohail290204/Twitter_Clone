# Twitter_Clone
I have made an Twitter Clone in ASP.NET C#. In which you can Register User and Login User. You can even Tweet which will be visible to all user at home page. You can even message other user personally and follow and unfollow other users and many other basic features.
To Open this file you have to open this folder in Microsoft Visual Studio Code and i have used microsoft SQL Server Management studio 18 as an database. 
First you have to run Register.aspx, from here you can create your account and then login.
